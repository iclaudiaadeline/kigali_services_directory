### "Gradle build failed"
**Solution**: 
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Firebase not initializing
**Solution**: Delete app from device and reinstall:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter run
```

### Google Maps not showing
**Solution**: 
1. Verify API key is correct
2. Check APIs are enabled in Google Cloud Console
3. Wait a few minutes for API key to activate

### Location permission denied
